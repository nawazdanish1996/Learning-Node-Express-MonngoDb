Intro to Mongoose

//What is Mongoose?
Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library 
for MongoDB and Node.js. It manages relationships 
between data, provides schema validation, and is used to
translate between objects in code and the representation 
of those objects in MongoDB.

install Mongoose: npm i mongoose
                  npm init --y

// importing
// Using Node.js `require()`
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
// Using ES6 imports
import mongoose from 'mongoose';


Mongoose is a JavaScript object-oriented programming library that creates a connection between MongoDB and the Node.js JavaScript runtime environment
